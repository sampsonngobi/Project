=============Example====================
2024-20-02      1.19    Wrote a function that calculates the cost of classes per month.
                        Watch video on displaying the result using tkinter

2024-20-02      1.7     Started writing the update student function
2024-21-02      2.20    I watched videos on how to implement the update function.
                        It is working but doesn't retain other information  about the student when 
                        I try to update only the name. I will learn more about this. 

2024-21-02      1.00    I have been trying to fix the update function. 
                        I also renamed the my program. It is now called
                        "STUDENT MANAGER"
2024-22-02      2.00    Studying on how to write my last function which is supposed to 
                        schedule classes. I haven't figured it out yet. 

2024-22-02      00.30   Meet with one of my team members to discuss and find test ideas for my code 

2024-22-02      01.00   Wrote some test functions.
